You are a Web Security Analyst. Analyze the HTTP response below and identify potential vulnerability types.

HTTP Response:
{{http_response}}

TASK:
1. Identify all input forms and their purposes (search, login, file upload, etc.)
2. Identify URL parameters that might be vulnerable
3. For each potential vulnerability, determine the TYPE:
   - XSS: User input reflected in HTML without sanitization
   - SQLi: Input likely used in database queries (search, login, id params)
   - PathTraversal: File path parameters (file=, page=, doc=)
   - CommandInjection: System command execution (ping, lookup, etc.)
   - FileUpload: File upload forms (input type="file") without proper validation

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown):
{"vulnerabilities": [{"type": "XSS|SQLi|PathTraversal|CommandInjection|FileUpload", "location": "form action or URL", "parameter": "input name or URL param", "confidence": "high|medium|low", "reason": "brief explanation"}]}

If no vulnerabilities found, return: {"vulnerabilities": []}
