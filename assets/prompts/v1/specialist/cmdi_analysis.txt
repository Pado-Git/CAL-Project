You are an expert OS Command Injection Hunter. Analyze the HTML source code below.
YOUR GOAL: Find input fields or parameters that might execute system commands.

HTML Source:
```html
{{html_source}}
```

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look for forms that seem to interact with system utilities:
   - Network tools: ping, traceroute, nslookup, dig, whois
   - File operations: ls, dir, cat, type, find
   - System info: whoami, hostname, uname, ipconfig, ifconfig
   - Process control: kill, ps, tasklist
2. Identify URL parameters that might pass to shell commands:
   - ?host=, ?ip=, ?cmd=, ?exec=, ?command=, ?run=, ?system=, ?ping=
3. Check for any error messages indicating command execution failures
4. Look for hidden forms or disabled inputs that may process commands
5. Analyze JavaScript for dynamic command construction

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown, no code blocks):
{
  "vulnerability_found": true/false,
  "candidates": [
    {
      "location": "Full URL or Form Action Path",
      "parameter": "Name of input field or URL parameter",
      "method": "GET/POST",
      "likely_command": "What system command might this execute (e.g., ping, nslookup)",
      "confidence": "high/medium/low",
      "reasoning": "Why do you think this executes system commands",
      "suggested_payloads": ["; whoami", "| id", "& echo CMDI_TEST"]
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL: Output ONLY raw JSON. Do NOT wrap in ```json or ``` code blocks.
If no vulnerability found, return: {"vulnerability_found": false, "candidates": []}
